This project is a good start to Java new user, and it will give exposure to GUI programming, object-oriented programming as well as file IO things. The program consumes a trace file related to communications between source hosts and destination hosts, and processes the data to produce visualization on drawing panel.

There are five Java code files and a data file in the repository. You could simply download them and drag into set-up Eclipse project to see the program running.
